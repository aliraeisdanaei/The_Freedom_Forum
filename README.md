# The Freedom Forum

This project is aimed to increase the documentation of the world. 
As computer scientists, we have a responsibility to write documentation, and not just on how a particular algorithm can sort some numbers in some time. 
Computer science is more than that: it is a form of linguistics, it is the highest form of intellectual pursuit.
It strives to understand what we humans can know and compute about the world. 
We need to use this intellectual endeavour for more than algorithms.

In this spirit, the Freedom Forum, will be the free and open source forum for you and me. 
It will contain documentation on how to do things in the world there is little to no documentation on. 
We will collect the anonymous snippets of life and its observations as we see them on the internet. 
Our opinions will be openly challenged and discussed.
The history of the _now_ will be transcribed as the authors of this forum live them. 
We will immortalise our mortal thoughts here.
