# What to Write

As I begin, this project, I have a thousand things I want to write about. 
About half of them give me concern and fear.
I am catching myself rejecting perfectly good files because of this fear.
It seems that I am truly never free of my speech. 

I can get in trouble by my brith country of Iran for saying the _wrong_ thing.
I can still get in trouble by the Iranians not Iran for saying _other wrong_ things that Iran would like. 
Even in Canada, and other countries more like Canada and less like Iran, the _wrong_ thing still begets trouble.

Inside all of us, there are enough thoughts to get us in trouble a thousand times. 
Yes, even you, and yes, even you in Canada as in Iran. 

These are the bitter truths of modern life. 
It takes boldness to always speak, headless, and will lead to disasters. 

Courage is to speak when one ought to, without fear. 
It takes prudence to know what to say and how to say it.

May God give me and the other authors of this project the courage backed by the prudence to write and not write as we should.
