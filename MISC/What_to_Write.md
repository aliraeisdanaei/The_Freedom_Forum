# What to Write

As I begin, this project, I have a thousand and one things I want to write about. 
About half of them give me concern and fear.
I am catching myself rejecting perfectly good files because of this fear.
It seems that I am truly never free of my speech. 

I can get in trouble by my brith country of Iran for saying the _wrong_ things.
I can get in trouble by other Iranians for saying _other wrong_ things. 
In every country, whether in Iran, countries less free than Iran, and even in Canada, the _wrong_ thing still begets trouble.

Inside me, there are enough thoughts to get in to trouble for a thousand and one ways. 
This is hardly a fact unique about me; it's true for everyone. 
Yes, even you, and yes, even you in Canada, Germany, Iran, or wherever else. 

These are the bitter truths of modern life. 
It takes boldness to always speak, and it will always lead to trouble. 

Courage is to speak when one ought to, without the fear of any _trouble_. 
It also takes prudence to know what to say and how to say it.

May God give me and the other authors of this project that courage and that prudence.
