# Contribution

You may contribute to this project as freely as you wish; however, this repository still belongs to its maintainers, therefore not everything will be merged. 

You may wish to contribute in the languages that the maintainers can adequately comment on. 
These are:
English, 
German,
Farsi, and 
French. 
More languages should be added as we become _polygloter_.


* Please contribute by forking this repository and creating a branch with your username.
Push your changes to your local branch, and pull request once done. 

* Please stick with markdown files with each sentence being separated by a line. 
No images, or if you want images have them as hyperlinks to reliable sources.

* If you collect things from the internet, _informally_ cite the platform.

* Have your file name be the same as your entry title. Don't use spaces in the file names; instead, use something like underscores.

* Update the table of contents after you have added your file. 

* If you wish to respond to a specific file (even if it is yours), append your response at the end of the file starting by a mention of it being a response from you. 
Also, tag the original authors of that file in your pull request.
